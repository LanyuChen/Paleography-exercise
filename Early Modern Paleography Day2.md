**Diuine PoÃ«ms**

**La Corona**

Deigne at my hand this Crowne of prayer, and praise

weau'd in my Low deuowt Melanchollie

Thou which of good, hast, yea art Treasurie

All changing, vnchang'd antient of dayes

But doe not with a vile Crowne gain'd, --(that) giue mee

A Crowne of glorie which doth flower alwayes

The ends Crowne our works, but thou crown'st our ends

For at our end beginns our endless rest

This first last end nowe zealouslie possest

which a strong sober thirst my Soule attends

Tis tyme that heart, and voice, bee lifte and(x) high

Saluation to all that will is nigh./

**Annunciation**

Saluation to all that will is nigh;

That alwayes is all euery where

which cannot sinn,and yet all sinns must beare

which cannot dye, yet cannot choose but dye

Loe faithfull virgin, yeilds himself to lye

In prison in thy wombe, and though bee there

Can take no sinn, nor thou guie, yet hee will weare

Taken from thence, flesh which Deaths force may trye

Ere, by the Spheres, tyme was created, thou

wast in his mind, who is thy sonne, and brother

whom thou conceiu'st conceiu'd; yea, thou art nowe

Thy Mothers maker, aand thy flathers Mother

Thou

Where like a pillowe on a bed

A pregnant banck swell'd vp to rest

The violetts reclying head

Satt wee two on anothers best

Our hands were firmely cimented

with a fast balme which thence did springe

Our eye-beames twisted, and did thred

Our eyes vpon one double stringe

Soe to intergrafte our hands, as yet

was all our meanes to make vs one

And pictures on our eyes to gett

was all our propagation

As twixt twoe equall Armyes, Fate

Suspends vncertaine victorie

Our Soules whhichh to aduaunce their state

were gone out, hunge twixt her, and mee

And whil'st our soules negotiate there

wee like Sepulchrall Statues lay

All day the same our postures were

And wee said nothing all the day.

If any soe by loue refin'de

That hee soules language vnderstood

And by good loue were growne all minde

which in Conuenient distance stood

Hee

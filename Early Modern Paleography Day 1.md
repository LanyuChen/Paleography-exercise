**My Transcription**

**Verses vpon the Duke of Buckinghams returne from the Ile of Rees**

And ar't returnd against with all thy faults

Thou greate Commander of the all go naughts

And left the Ile behinde thee? whta's the matter

Did winter make thy Chapps to Chatter,

Could not the Surging,and distempred seas

thy queasy stomacke (gorg'd) with sweete meats please

Or didst thou sodainly remooue thy Station

throughe Jealousy of Hollands Supplantation

Or was't for want of wenches, or didst feare

the king (thou absent) durst wrong'd Bristoll heare,

Or didst thou hasten headlong to prevent

A fruitlesse hope't for needfull Parliament?

All these noe question with a restlesse motion

Vext thy bespotted soule, as that blacke potion

tortur'd the Noble Scott, whose Ghost can tell

thy swolne ambition made his carcase swell,

But theirs a reason worse then this, they say

the Frenchmen beats thee, and thou ran'st away

Can this bee true, could not thy glorious boast

before thy goeing: fright them from that Coast?

Could not thy Cambridge pupills zealous prayers

compos'd of Brownish, and Arminian ayres

confound thy hopeles /fruit/ hoope the fruitlesse fraction

Could not thy Parliament Majesticke Voews

Prevayle t'impose the garland on thy browes

Could not thy Chaplaine Londons sacrifice

nor moue, nor suffocate the destinies

that sends from paunches Altarr more furmes forth

of Smoake, and vapour, then Landaphe is worth

Could not thy mothers masses, nor her Crosses

Nor her sorceries, pevent these fatall losses

Nor Regall wishes, nor embraces neither,

Nor th'armies Vallour, nor all these together

Hence wee conclude, to these the will be vitious

Pray will, pray, Heauen will not bee propitious

God's deafe to them, the will not heare the cryes

Of these oppressed subiests injuries,
